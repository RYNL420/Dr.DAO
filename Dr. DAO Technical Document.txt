🔧 DR. DAO – Technical Specification for Development
📌 Objective
To build Dr. DAO, an autonomous AI-guided treasury manager for DAOs, featuring:
* AgentKit-based AI agent ("Dr. DAO")

* Futarchy governance system (onchain-compatible)

* Onchain asset deployment (swaps, staking, yield farming)

* Rebalancing and treasury monitoring

* Easy-to-use, transparent frontend

________________


🧠 AI Agent Design
Framework: AgentKit (Coinbase Base)
Purpose: Create an autonomous decision-making loop that:
   * Monitors Base and Ethereum markets

   * Analyzes yield opportunities (e.g., Aave, Lido, Aerodrome)

   * Produces structured recommendations for the DAO (e.g., "Stake 20% USDC in Aave")

   * Interfaces with a futarchy voting mechanism for execution approval

Stack:
      * AgentKit: Agent lifecycle, planning, and state memory

      * LangChain: LLM orchestration for parsing DeFi data and structuring outputs

      * LlamaIndex: Indexing DAO financial data and proposal history

Inputs:
         * Treasury state (wallet balances, historical strategies)

         * Protocol data (APRs, TVL, risk scores from APIs or The Graph)

         * DAO goals (runway, risk profile)

Output Format:
json
CopyEdit
{
  "recommendation": "Stake 20% USDC in Aave v3 for 4.5% APY",
  "rationale": "Aave currently has the highest yield with low risk exposure on USDC. Liquidity is sufficient, and risk analysis indicates minimal drawdown.",
  "action": {
    "protocol": "Aave",
    "asset": "USDC",
    "amount": "20%",
    "duration": "flexible"
  }
}

⚖️ Futarchy-Based Voting Module
Concept: Each recommendation by Dr. DAO is passed to a futarchy poll, where prediction markets assess the expected impact on treasury performance.
Technical Stack:
            * Smart Contracts:

               * Use a fork or adaptation of Gnosis Conditional Tokens for outcome markets

               * Custom governance contract to:

                  * Trigger futarchy vote on agent's recommendation

                  * Set time limit (e.g., 48 hours)

                  * Aggregate winning outcome and approve execution if market favors "positive ROI"

                     * Prediction Market UI: Integrate with frontend using The Graph to fetch real-time prices/odds for proposals

                     * Oracle Integration (optional, future-proofing):

                        * Use UMA Oracle to settle outcome of prediction markets (e.g., "Did treasury increase over 30 days after action?")

🛠️ Smart Contract Layer
Environment:
                           * Base L2 (Primary)

                           * Ethereum Mainnet (Interoperable)

Contracts to Develop:
                              1. Vault Manager

                                 * Holds DAO assets

                                 * Approves execution only if futarchy vote is passed

                                 * Records action history

                                    2. Rebalancer Contract

                                       * Executes yield farming, swaps, and withdrawals

                                       * Callable by AgentKit via permissioned function

                                          3. Futarchy Voting

                                             * Creates/settles conditional token markets for recommendations

                                             * Connects to frontend and oracle (optional)

                                                4. Treasury Access Control

                                                   * Role-based permissions: Agent, Admin, DAO voter

Libraries:
                                                      * OpenZeppelin for ERC20, roles, and governance templates

                                                      * Gnosis Safe SDK for multisig compatibility
